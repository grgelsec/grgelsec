## howdy!

my name is George Lisec, i am currently a junior at indiana universtiy majoring in computer science and minoring in math and data science. i started learning front-end in january 2024 and since then i have had so much fun learning and coding has quickly become my favorite hobby. my first year and a half studying cs at university were rough, i didnt love coding or apply myself and i thought oppoutunities would just come my way. it wasn't until i started learning and building what i found interesting that coding became a passion. whether im in college or the field i am always going to be a student and so this is a log of my learning and improvement.
